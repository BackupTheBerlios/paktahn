Paktahn is designed to be a successor to the popular Yaourt
package manager.

It's a Pacman wrapper that also knows how to search and install
packages from AUR.


Current advantages over Yaourt:

  * allows use of alternative Pacman binaries (e.g. Powerpill)

  * caches local dbs for exceptional speed (soon for AUR too!)

  * way better security and extensibility


Hints:

== Shortcut: pak

Paktahn comes with a symlink called "pak".


== Interactive search/install mode

  pak SEARCH

will search all dbs from pacman.conf (excluding local)
and AUR for SEARCH in the name and description of packages.


== Install a specific package

  pak -S PKG

will find and install PKG from sync dbs or AUR.


== Use Powerpill instead of Pacman:

  (setf *pacman-binary* "powerpill")

This assumes that powerpill is in your $PATH.
