/** Compare two version strings and determine which one is 'newer'.
 * Returns a value comparable to the way strcmp works. Returns 1
 * if a is newer than b, 0 if a and b are the same version, or -1
 * if b is newer than a.
 *
 * Keep in mind that the pkgrel is only compared if it is available
 * on both versions handed to this function. For example, comparing
 * 1.5-1 and 1.5 will yield 0; comparing 1.5-1 and 1.5-2 will yield
 * -1 as expected. This is mainly for supporting versioned dependencies
 * that do not include the pkgrel.
