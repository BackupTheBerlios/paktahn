for next release:

  * short banner (and config option to disable it)

  * website, proper help/docs

  * edit http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/AUR_Helpers#yaourt
     and http://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Yaourt

  * proper getopt support, -Sy, -Q, -Ql, -Qs

  * compile packages from repos (yaourt -Sb)


later:

  * start querying aur in a separate thread while
    searching local

  * smart regexp/wildcard mode (detect ^ $ * ?)

  * proper getopt support, -Sy, -Q, -Ql, -Qs

  * list package group members

  * allow Ctrl+C to stop searching and present the choices gathered
    up to that point right away

  * add md5/sha1 (makepkg -g) if they are missing, after asking the user

  * -G: just download and unpack AUR tarball of package

  * URI: download pkgbuild or tarball and process it

  * better support for standardized colored output
    (e.g. highlight repos in info messages, support nested progress levels)

  * basic versioning support (package-installed-p)

  * sorting the output of an AUR search ie. alphabetically, votes,
    date submitted, last updated etc. (by quigybo)

  * actively support versioned deps

  * support su (and friends) besides sudo

  * show dep chain

  * don't offer restarts if there are no packages left in the
    install queue and the only restarts are SKIP and QUIT.

  * remove stale pacman locks as part of RUN-PACMAN's unwind-protect

  * detect stale pacman locks

  * interrupt: offer continue restart

  * show backtrace/enter debugger restart

  * patched sbcl

  * AUR cache

  * show summary of what has been done before exit 

  * fix network restarts -- they should only be offered when the
    network connection failed (in particular SIGINT should not offer them)
