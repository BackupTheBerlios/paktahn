before initial release:

  * -G: just download and unpack AUR tarball of package

  * URI: download pkgbuild or tarball and process it

  * banner (and config option to disable it)

  * support for pkg groups

  * color schemes/lightbg color scheme

  * better support for standardized colored output
    (e.g. highlight repos in info messages, support nested progress levels)

  * show backtrace/enter debugger restart

  * basic versioning support (package-installed-p)

  * patched sbcl

  * $EDITOR: other than vim, invalid

  * record PKGBUILD md5 so we don't present the same file
    repeatedly to the user for review

  * add arch=i686 automatically, x86_64 after asking

  * add md5/sha1 (makepkg -g) if they are missing, after asking the user

  * proper getopt support, -Sy, -Q, -Ql, -Qs

  * website, proper help/docs


later:

  * proper SIGINT handling: http://www.cons.org/cracauer/sigint.html

  * sorting the output of an AUR search ie. alphabetically, votes,
    date submitted, last updated etc. (by quigybo)

  * actively support versioned deps

  * support su (and friends) besides sudo

  * show dep chain
