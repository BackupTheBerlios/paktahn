before initial release:

  * cache lock
  * record PKGBUILD md5 so we don't present the same file
    repeatedly to the user for review
  * only refresh caches of dbs that have actually changed.
  * use OSICAT for file/dir ops
  * only install/upgrade packages if they're not in local already;
    but check versions!
  * actively support versioned deps
  * better support for standardized colored output
  * lightbg color scheme
  * proper getopt support
  * support convenient building of Paktahn from source (get deps, invoke sbcl)
  * website
  * proper help
  * add arch=i686 automatically, x86_64 after asking

later:

  * proper SIGINT handling: http://www.cons.org/cracauer/sigint.html
